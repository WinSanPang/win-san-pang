      "Aside from frequent trips to Hong Kong, I've also enjoyed exploring other parts of Asia, including Thailand, Singapore and Japan, as well as Europe, including Hungary, Greece and Iceland. I found that travelling has really expanded my horizons and understanding of different cultures, and with each new destination I discover new flavours, experiences and sensations that makes our world beautifully colourful.",

      "I wasn't a good swimmer as a kid and from my teen years onwards I stopped swimming entirely. They say you never forget to swim, but I really did and became afraid of deep water. It wasn't until early 2019 that I started learning to swim again, owing much credit to my partner's patient teaching. In October 2019, I swam in the sea without my feet being anywhere near the ground for the first time ever. It felt incredible. These days I take every opportunity I can to swim, whether it be in the sea or a swimming pool." +
      "\n \n" +
      "Re-learning to swim reaffirmed my belief that it's never too late to learn and I feel this mirrors my coding journey. I started learning to code in 2018, aged 26, which isn't an 'old' age to learn, but I'm certainly older than the fresh graduates of Computer Science. I didn't let this hold me back and, in January 2020, my hard work and determination paid off as I finally earned the title of Associate Frontend Engineer. These days, I also take every opportunity to code, whether it be for work or in my personal time for fun :)",

I find it tremendously satifying to start with a pile of Lego bricks and build my way up to a completed model, which probably explains why I've come to love coding and building websites from scratch. When I'm building Lego, my mind is totally focused but also relaxed. Sometimes, it can be a really good test of my patience, not dissimilar to trying to crack bug fixes for legacy codebases...",

I really enjoy cooking a range of different dishes, ranging from oven bakes to sushi, but my special dish has to be my Mum's Soya Sauce Chicken Wings recipe. I was quite a picky eater as a child, so my Mum lovingly created this recipe for me, and I really could eat Soya Sauce Chicken wings for days!",
